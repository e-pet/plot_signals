Two simple plotting functions for convenient one-line plotting of multiple signals in Matlab.
The standard Matlab functions require quite a few lines of code to set up a plot with one subplot per matrix row/column, linking the axes of the different subplots, labeling the different subplots, etc.
These functions were designed to make that process as simple and pain-free as possible, while also allowing for loads of customization (e.g., log plots, vlines, additional reference signals for comparison, etc.) where required.

**plot_signals** generates a single figure with subplots of signals contained in a matrix. All signals are plotted against a common x axis, and various visual tweaks are employed to make the plot more useful and visually appealing than the default plots.
Many options are available for customizing the result to individual requirements.

**compare_signals** works similarly but takes a cell array of matrices with signals to be compared against another directly, creating subplots with one line per matrix provided.

Instructions for demo cases can be found in the documentation of both functions.

If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please let me know!
